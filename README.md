Description: The internship program via online bootcamp of [CBD Robotics](https://www.cbdrobot.com/Home.html) company for over 4 months. My assignments appeared to be simple and straightforward, but they were actually quite complex and are the products of many months of hard work. I’m continuing to try my best to improve it.

# Review
**TL;DR:** I learned so much knowledge from this training course. Since I compared between other courses (in Vietnam) so I highly recommend it for those who want to work in the AI/ Data Science field to get a better understanding and improve their skills.

**In detail:**<br>
- First of all, I sent my resume to the company to apply for the internship program on Mar 2019 and got their response after a month.
- The fee was $300 and I joined their training via screen sharing on Skype platform with other classmates. You will use Python language for programing and upload your assignment projects on your github.
- At first, you don’t need to have a strong CPU and GPU while learning BUT you will need it later when you start in the Deep Learning part. That is why I bought my new hardware at the end of the course and it worked well! (CPU intel core i5-9400F,GPU Nvidia GTX 1060 6GB). You could use free Cloud computing like Google Colab instead of buying new hardware like me but there is always a trade-off, you will see!

**Pros:**
- Interactive with an experienced mentor. He is an expert [data scientist](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ducdan/) and he has wide knowledge in this field. So the practical knowledge I gained from our discussions were a valuable asset. Knowledge is power, no doubt!
- Allow recording video from the class. Some other courses as I know in Vietnam don’t let their students record video from their class, even though their class worked on telecommunication platforms. I found that ridiculous. So I’m glad when the company let us do it.
- Feel free to ask questions. If you have something in your mind when you are in the class, just send it on the chat box. It’s also okay to ask the mentor through Skype messenger after class.

**Cons:**
- The approximate time for studying after class is about 17 hours a week. It wasn’t true, at least for me. If you haven’t had any fundamental knowledge in this field just like me, you might want to spend additional time to learn how to use libraries, read new lessons and prepare for your assignment projects.
- The documents could be improved. Most of them were slides from various authors so I often feel confused with abstract contents and notations from these documents since they weren’t in synchronization. It would be a good idea to learn outside the classroom, maybe from practice books.
- There are a lot of things in this field that are math-heavy, and I’m not strong in mathematics so it was hard for me to catch up in those lessons. The Deep Learning unit and latter sections were taught at a very fast pace too.

**Conclusions:**
- Before joining the course, I did self-study about machine learning. I barely understood the concepts in it and felt it difficult to understand the processing how they did in tutorials. Basically I have gotten a better understanding now. I am more confident and even could answer some questions in “basic machine learning group” without hesitating.
- I’m still weak at mathematics, visualization, processing data, and clustering so they will be my new targets to further improve.
